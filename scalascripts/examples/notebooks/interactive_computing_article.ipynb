    "It lets you write expressions in a terminal window, and immediately prints the return value as well as any outputs to the console.\n",

    "## Ammonite\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ammonite](http://ammonite.io/#Ammonite-REPL) is a modern REPL implementation created by Li Haoyi. It comes with many features that make working in the REPL more convenient. Probably the most important one is dynamic maven dependency loading in the REPL itself (through [Coursier](https://coursier.github.io/coursier/snapshot/docs/intro)), which allows you to import and immediately use almost any published Scala or Java library. It also has many others convenience features, such as\n",
    "* multi line editing support\n",
    "* better syntax highlighting. i.e. inputs are highlighted as you type\n",
    "* much better autocompletion\n",
    "* pretty printed, nicely formatted outputs\n",
    "* undo/redo, session handling and more\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know Python, Ammonite (roughly) is to the default Scala REPL what the [IPython](https://ipython.org/) shell is to the default Python shell. Parts of Ammonite are also used in the default dotty REPL, which means they will be available in Scala 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Ammonite has many improvements compared to the default REPL, the basic execution model is still the same.\n",
    "You enter an expression (or multiple expressions in a block). You press enter to have it evaluated to immediately see the output below your input. You then repeat with a new expression or by refining the previous one and executing it again. As a result, your inputs are interleaved with the computed output values.\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>The Ammonite REPL (Source: ammonite.io)</em></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This model of interaction helps you to iterate fast due to the immediate feedback, but it also has some drawbacks:\n",
    "* Seeing multiple inputs at once can be hard, because they are interleaved with their outputs, especially if the outputs are long.\n",
    "* It also makes it harder to copy multiple consecutive inputs into an editor.\n",
    "* Finding and changing older inputs often means scrolling back or searching the history because they are far away or  in the console window completely gone due to newer outputs.\n",
    "* Selectively replaying multiple expressions after changes in an earlier input or after a REPL restart can be tedious.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can show the history of inputs using `:history` in the default REPL or `repl.history` in Ammonite. While the history can be helpful, it is often cluttered with refinement attempts, which you still need to filter out.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting REPL variant that addresses some of these issues are worksheets."

    "## Worksheets\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Dotty documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A worksheet is a Scala file that is evaluated on save, and the result of each expression is shown in a column to the right of your program. Worksheets are like a REPL session on steroids, and enjoy 1st class editor support: completion, hyperlinking, interactive errors-as-you-type, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://dotty.epfl.ch/images/worksheets/worksheet-demo.gif\" alt=\"Worksheet support in Dotty IDE\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Worksheet example in Dotty IDE / Visual Studio Code. (source: <a href=\"https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/usage/worksheet-mode.html\">Dotty documentation</a>)</em></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through this definition to explain how worksheets differ from the REPL:\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, worksheets are files. That means we can put them under version control and share them with others more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we enter our expressions into an editor window. In most cases, the input editor is on the left while the output is shown to the right. This layout makes it easier to see multiple expressions at once, because they are not interleaved with their outputs. It also makes it easier to write multi line expressions and to edit expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, a worksheet is evaluated on save. More specifically, **all** expressions are recomputed every time we save the worksheet. The advantage of this behaviour is that it's easy to change an earlier expression because all dependent values are automatically recomputed. The drawback is that you lose control over which expressions are evaluated so it's not very well suited for things that take longer than a few seconds like loading large datasets or running complex computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth point about editor support is mostly IDE dependent. Dotty IDE worksheet support looks very nice, but most of us are still stuck with Scala 2. I've tried IntelliJ worksheets a few times but they didn't work very well for me. Eclipse based Scala IDE had good worksheet support last time I tried it but isn't widely used for other reasons. There's also an online worksheet variant called [Scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/) that only requires a browser and makes it very easy to share worksheets online.\n",
    "\n",
    "So worksheets solve some of the issues of REPLs mentioned above. Their layout and their execution model makes multiple expressions easier to read and to change, even if their outputs are shown. However, the execution model also introduces new issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the natural question that follows is: Could we combine the advantages of REPL and worksheets somehow? Interestingly, there is a technology that does have most of the advantages of both (and more): *Jupyter notebooks*."

If you look closer though, many of them are somewhat limited in features, have scalability issues or have even been abandoned.

    "Building on Ammonite also highlights a more general design principle of Almond. It tries to delegate as much functionality as possible to existing components instead of reinventing the wheel. Doing so allows it to stay more lightweight, easier to understand, and to better focus on its core functionality as a kernel. While Almond has used a forked version of Ammonite for some time, the changes have been upstreamed and it now includes stock Ammonite. This is unlike other kernels which have often heavily customized and extended the Scala REPL to fit their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almond is not tied to a specific big-data framework like Spark. That doesn't mean we can't have framework integrations, quite on the contrary. But the idea is to do bridging and integration in more standardized way instead of having to customize the REPL or the kernel itself. Ideally, the integration is done as a module or a separate library that talks to the kernel via well defined APIs. For interfacing with a Spark cluster for instance, Almond relies on [ammonite-spark](https://github.com/alexarchambault/ammonite-spark) in combination with providing a Jupyter specific Spark module.\n",

    "## Combining the Advantages of REPLs and Worksheets\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now get back to the question how Jupyter notebooks combine the advantages of REPLs & worksheets. In a sense, you can think of a notebook as a REPL of worksheets (cells).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each code cell roughly corresponds to a worksheet. You have an editor window to enter your expressions, and once you hit run, **all** expressions in a cell are evaluated in one go and the outputs are shown below.\n",
    "Since notebooks are files, you can also save them, share them and put them under version control like worksheets. So the behaviour inside a cell is basically worksheet like, except that by default, the output is not on the right hand side but below the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook can have as many cells as you like, though, and at the document level it behaves more like a REPL. You enter one or more expressions in a cell, run it, perhaps refine and run again a few times until you're happy. Then you create a new cell below the current one (which may depend on values from the cell above) and repeat the process.\n",
    "The way you can control which cell will be executed is actually even more flexible. You can, for instance\n",
    "* select any cell and (re-)run it\n",
    "* Run all cells, or all cells above/below the currently selected cell\n",
    "* Insert a new cell anywhere, or delete an existing one\n",
    "* copy and paste cells\n",
    "* easily rearrange cells as you like\n",
    "* merge or split cells\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a very powerful toolbox for experimentation. Because you can execute and rearrange cells arbitrarily, sometimes you end up with cells containing expressions which depend on values from cells below. \n",
    "This can be very confusing so you should make sure that your code runs fine when executing your notebook in linear order, especially if you want to share it. There's a talk called [I Don't Like Notebooks](https://youtu.be/7jiPeIFXb6U) by Joel Grus about those traps and about Jupyter notebooks from a Software Engineering perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/jupyter_productivity_tweet.png\" alt=\"Jupyter Notebooks productivity\" width=\"550px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Since cells in one notebook share the same kernel and its interpreter variable state, they can depend on values computed by other cells executed earlier.\n",
    "So you could have a cell on top of your notebook that loads a large dataset or runs a complex computation and the results will be cached and available to all cells executed later, as long as the kernel isn't restarted. In essence, notebooks defuse the main disadvantage of worksheets by combining its execution model with the one of the REPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "While outputs are shown below a cell by default, interleaving of input and output is between cells, not between single expressions as in The REPL. That means you can always see the code of a cell as a whole. You can also easily clear the output of a cell or of all cells to see all your inputs more clearly. Last but not least can you also export your notebook as a Scala file containing all your code input cells."

Newer frontends like JupyterLab and nteract are more restrictive about JavaScript execution for security reasons. That's why plotly-scala also sends a json representation of our plot which is then rendered by nteract or the [JupyterLab Plotly extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers/tree/master/packages/plotly-extension).\n",

That's why interactive notebooks have recently been named the third most important tool for data scientists.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope that I could convince you that Jupyter notebooks are a powerful and incredibly flexible tool for interactive computing. \n",
    "As we've seen, they combine many strengths of the REPL and worksheets, while also adding unique new features.\n",
    "Their web-based interface, interleaving code with documentation, and the ability to send rich outputs from your code to the frontend give you a wealth of possibilies for things like prototyping, data visualization, communication of results, and teaching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Almond kernel](https://almond-sh.github.io/almond/stable) makes that power available for Scala, including all the niceties of Ammonite. Even though it still needs some more integrations and documentation, it's already quite usable and fun to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see more examples of what's possible with Jupyter and Almond, check out the [examples repo](https://github.com/almond-sh/examples). It consists of a growing collection of Jupyter notebooks, each containing executable Scala code. You can run all these notebooks in your browser without any local setup, [using Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/almond-sh/examples/master?urlpath=lab).\n",
